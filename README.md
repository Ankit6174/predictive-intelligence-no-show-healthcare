# Problem Statement for git: 
#### Every day, hospitals face a serious challenge: patients book appointments but don't show up, without any notice. These missed appointments — called “no-shows” — waste doctors’ valuable time, increase operational costs, and delay treatment for other patients who genuinely need care. 

This project aims to develop a machine learning-based predictive system that helps hospitals identify in advance which patients are likely to miss their appointments. By analyzing historical appointment data and patient behavior, the system can assist hospital staff in making data-driven decisions, such as sending follow-up reminders, reallocating time slots, or even flagging high-risk cases — ultimately leading to better healthcare efficiency and reduced patient wait times.

### Problem statement for linkedin:
``Hospitals lose time and resources due to patients not showing up for appointments. This project builds an ML model that predicts likely no-shows in advance, helping hospitals improve efficiency and reduce delays in patient care.``
